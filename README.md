# library app
a simple app using sqlite backend that helps to facilitate the check-in/check-out
of books, allows users to store/maintain patron data, and tracks transactions.

A directory containing 2 files is created on first run of this application.
In your home directory, a folder called LibraryApp is created. Inside this new
folder 2 files are created: db.properties and library.db

modify db.properties to connect to a different database.
